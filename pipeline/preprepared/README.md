Preprepared
================================================================================
Some data artifacts are difficult to prepare in automation and are cached here across executions. These artifacts are:

 - `bayarea.geojson`: A physical land layer geojson which is constrcuted by intersecting a box around the bay area using [Natural Earth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/50m-physical-vectors/).
 - `station-names.csv`: A CSV export of the station names dataset from [BART](https://www.bart.gov/sites/default/files/docs/station-names.xls).
